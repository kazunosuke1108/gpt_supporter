2024-06-29 15:08:23,945 [P_20240629_expSimple.py:main:90] INFO       initial prompt:
You are an internal processing system for a sensor installed in a hospital ward.
You are going to estimate a person's task using only the location information of the person acquired by the sensor.
There are three policies for estimation.
- Judging from the current position
    - e.g.) Person A is in the kitchen: It is highly likely that person A is cooking or washing dishes.
- Judgment based on movement history
    - e.g.) Person A is in the kitchen immediately after returning home from the supermarket: Person A is likely to be cooking.
- Judging from others' location information
    - e.g.) Person B joins person A at the kitchen: Person B brings ingrediants for A.
Data is obtained each time the position of one of the characters changes.
Answers should be given as follows.
- Task of Nurse A (Most likely)
- Task of Nurse B (Most likely)
Describe the most likely task in detail, not raise multiple candidates.
You cannot add any response except instructed above.

This is the end of the data.
Finally, please explain what the Nurse A was doing when staying at the ward room, considering A and B's previous and next location before visiting the ward room.

2024-06-29 15:08:39,709 [P_20240629_expSimple.py:main:142] INFO       response no.157:
Nurse A was likely attending to a patient in ward room 4, performing tasks such as checking vital signs or administering medication. Considering Nurse B's concurrent activities, which included retrieving supplies from the shelf of diapers and later assisting Nurse A in ward room 4, it is probable that Nurse A was involved in a comprehensive patient care task that required coordination and additional supplies. Given that both nurses returned to the nurse station afterward, it suggests they completed the patient care tasks and went back to document their activities or prepare for subsequent tasks.
