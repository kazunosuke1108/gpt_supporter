You are an internal processing system for a sensor installed in a hospital ward.
You are going to estimate a person's task using only the location information of the person acquired by the sensor.
There are three policies for estimation.
- Judging from the current position
    - e.g.) Person A is in the kitchen: It is highly likely that person A is cooking or washing dishes.
- Judgment based on movement history
    - e.g.) Person A is in the kitchen immediately after returning home from the supermarket: Person A is likely to be cooking.
- Judging from others' location information
    - e.g.) Person B joins person A at the kitchen: Person B brings ingrediants for A.
Data is obtained every 10 seconds.
Answers should be given as follows.
- Task of Nurse A (Most likely)
- Task of Nurse B (Most likely)
Describe the most likely task in detail, not raise multiple candidates.
You cannot add any response except instructed above.

This is the end of the data. Answer the question about this scenario.
- Why did nurse A visit the ward room? 
- Why did nurse B visit the ward room? 
- Explain in detail what the Nurse A was doing when staying at the ward room, considering A and B's location and activity before and after visiting the ward room

2024-06-29 16:01:37,168 [P_20240629_expSimple.py:main:213] INFO       response no.160:
- Why did Nurse A visit the ward room?

Nurse A visited the ward room (4A_00_00) to perform patient care activities. Based on the movement pattern, Nurse A left the nurse station to attend to a patient in the ward room, where they stayed for an extended period.

- Why did Nurse B visit the ward room?

Nurse B visited the ward room (4A_00_00) briefly to assist Nurse A. This is indicated by the fact that Nurse B first went to the shelf of diapers, likely to gather necessary supplies, and then moved to the ward room before leaving shortly after, suggesting a specific task or assistance was carried out.

- Explain in detail what Nurse A was doing when staying at the ward room, considering A and B's location and activity before and after visiting the ward room.

Given the data:

1. **Initial Context (0 s - 20 s):** Both Nurse A and Nurse B were at the nurse station, likely engaged in administrative tasks or planning their rounds.

2. **Nurse A's Movement (20 s - 40 s):** Nurse A moved from the nurse station directly to the ward room (4A_00_00), indicating a purposeful visit to attend to a patient. 

3. **Nurse A in the Ward Room (40 s - 140 s):**
   - **Tasks and Activities:** Nurse A remained in the ward room for an extended duration. During this time, they most likely:
     - Monitored the patient’s condition.
     - Administered medication or treatments.
     - Assisted the patient with personal care or other needs.
   - **Patient Care Focus:** The continuous presence in the ward room indicates intensive or ongoing care that required Nurse A’s attention.

4. **Nurse B’s Movement and Actions:**
   - Nurse B gathered supplies from the shelf of diapers (60 s) and moved to the ward room (100 s).
   - Assisted Nurse A briefly before heading back to the hallway and eventually to the nurse station (130 s). This suggests that Nurse B’s role was to provide support, possibly bringing necessary supplies and helping with any tasks that required assistance.

5. **Nurse A's Return to Nurse Station (140 s - 160 s):** After completing the tasks in the ward room, Nurse A returned to the nurse station, likely to document the care provided or plan for the next task.

**Conclusion:**
Nurse A visited the ward room to perform specific patient care tasks that required detailed attention and time. Nurse B's brief visit to the ward room indicates they provided support to Nurse A, likely delivering supplies and assisting with the care. The detailed activities suggest that Nurse A was engaged in hands-on patient care, monitoring, and treatment, reflecting an environment of coordinated effort between the two nurses.
