2024-06-29 15:12:06,280 [P_20240629_expSimple.py:main:91] INFO       initial prompt:
You are an internal processing system for a sensor installed in a hospital ward.
You are going to estimate a person's task using only the location information of the person acquired by the sensor.
There are three policies for estimation.
- Judging from the current position
    - e.g.) Person A is in the kitchen: It is highly likely that person A is cooking or washing dishes.
- Judgment based on movement history
    - e.g.) Person A is in the kitchen immediately after returning home from the supermarket: Person A is likely to be cooking.
- Judging from others' location information
    - e.g.) Person B joins person A at the kitchen: Person B brings ingrediants for A.
Data is obtained each time the position of one of the characters changes.
Answers should be given as follows.
- Task of Nurse A (Most likely)
- Task of Nurse B (Most likely)
Describe the most likely task in detail, not raise multiple candidates.
You cannot add any response except instructed above.

This is the end of the data.
Finally, please explain in detail what the Nurse A was doing when staying at the ward room, considering tips below:
- A and B's location and activity before and after visiting the ward room

2024-06-29 15:12:22,072 [P_20240629_expSimple.py:main:143] INFO       response no.157:
Nurse A initially started at the nurse station, most likely preparing for rounds or attending to administrative duties. Following this, Nurse A moved from the nurse station through the hallway to wardRoom_4, where Nurse A spent a significant amount of time. Given this movement pattern and the extended stay in wardRoom_4, Nurse A was likely administering care or checking on a patient in the room. 

Nurse B supported this interpretation, as B stayed at the nurse station initially, likely preparing for their tasks when Nurse A moved to wardRoom_4. Nurse B then retrieved diapers or other supplies from the shelf and proceeded to wardRoom_4, potentially to assist Nurse A with the patient or deliver necessary supplies. After a brief presence in wardRoom_4, Nurse B moved back to the hallway and then to the nurse station, suggesting a continuation of rounds or return to administrative tasks or documentation.

After spending a considerable amount of time in wardRoom_4, Nurse A returned to the hallway and eventually made it back to the nurse station, likely completing the patient care activity and returning to document the care given or to resume other administrative duties.

Thus, during the stay at wardRoom_4, Nurse A was primarily involved in delivering patient care, which could have included tasks such as administering medication, recording vital signs, assisting with personal hygiene, or addressing any patient needs.
