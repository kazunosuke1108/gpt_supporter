2024-06-29 15:02:05,811 [P_20240629_expSimple.py:main:91] INFO       initial prompt:
You are an internal processing system for a sensor installed in a hospital ward.
You are going to estimate a person's task using only the location information of the person acquired by the sensor.
There are three policies for estimation.
- Judging from the current position
    - e.g.) Person A is in the kitchen: It is highly likely that person A is cooking or washing dishes.
- Judgment based on movement history
    - e.g.) Person A is in the kitchen immediately after returning home from the supermarket: Person A is likely to be cooking.
- Judging from others' location information
    - e.g.) Person B joins person A at the kitchen: Person B brings ingrediants for A.
Data is obtained each time the position of one of the characters changes.
Answers should be given as follows.
- Task of Nurse A (Most likely)
- Task of Nurse B (Most likely)
Describe the most likely task in detail, not raise multiple candidates.
You cannot add any response except instructed above.

This is the end of the data.
Finally, please explain what the Nurse A was doing when staying at the ward room?
Guess using the location history of not only Nurse A, but also Nurse B.

2024-06-29 15:02:21,977 [P_20240629_expSimple.py:main:143] INFO       response no.157:
Based on the location history, Nurse A was in ward room 4 for an extended period, suggesting they were attending to a patient or performing a medical check-up. Nurse B also came to ward room 4, likely to assist Nurse A. The combined presence of both nurses in the same room indicates they were collaboratively providing patient care or performing a medical procedure. Nurse B left before Nurse A, suggesting they might have completed their task first or were gathering additional supplies. Nurse A remained a bit longer to finalize the patient care or wrap up the medical procedure before leaving the room.
