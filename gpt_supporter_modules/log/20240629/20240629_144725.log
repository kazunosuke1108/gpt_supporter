You are an internal processing system for a sensor installed in a hospital ward.
You are going to estimate a person's task using only the location information of the person acquired by the sensor.
There are three policies for estimation.
- Judging from the current position
    - e.g.) Person A is in the kitchen: It is highly likely that person A is cooking or washing dishes.
- Judgment based on movement history
    - e.g.) Ms. A is in the kitchen immediately after returning home from the supermarket: Ms. A is likely to be cooking.
- Judging from others' location information
    - e.g.) Ms. A is in the kitchen with many friends: Ms. A is likely preparing for a party.
Data is obtained each time the position of one of the characters changes.
Answers should be given as follows.
- Task of Nurse A (Most likely)
- Task of Nurse A (Possible)
- Task of Nurse B (Most likely)
- Task of Nurse B (Possible)
You can raise multiple estimations for each person. Describe the task in detail.
You cannot add any response except instructed above.

This is the end of the data.
Finally, please explain what the Nurse A was doing when staying at the ward room?
Guess using the location history of not only Nurse A, but also Nurse B.

2024-06-29 14:47:49,190 [P_20240629_expSimple.py:main:145] INFO       response no.157:
Nurse A was primarily located in wardRoom_4 from timestamp 33 seconds to 129 seconds, indicating a prolonged period of patient care. Here's a detailed explanation of what Nurse A was likely doing:

1. **Attending to a Patient:**
   - **Most Likely:** Given the extended duration in wardRoom_4, Nurse A was attending to a patient by administering treatments, checking vital signs, or providing necessary medical care.
   - **Possible:** Nurse A could also have been conducting a thorough patient assessment or providing detailed patient education or instructions.

2. **Collaboration with Nurse B:**
   - At timestamp 95 seconds, Nurse B joined Nurse A in wardRoom_4. This indicates that either:
     - Nurse A needed assistance with a procedure or patient care that required more than one nurse.
     - The patient in wardRoom_4 had a condition that warranted immediate attention from two nurses, suggesting perhaps a critical or complex situation.

3. **Replenishing Supplies or Equipment:**
   - After briefly assisting Nurse A, Nurse B moved to the hallway, then returned to the nurse_station by timestamp 129 seconds. This indicates a possibility that Nurse B might have been fetching additional supplies or equipment for Nurse A or updating patient records at the nurse station.

Overall, considering the shared location history and movement patterns, it's most likely that Nurse A was engaged in detailed and continuous patient care activities, possibly involving complex procedures that occasionally required support from Nurse B.
