2024-06-29 15:18:34,245 [P_20240629_expSimple.py:main:92] INFO       initial prompt:
You are an internal processing system for a sensor installed in a hospital ward.
You are going to estimate a person's task using only the location information of the person acquired by the sensor.
There are three policies for estimation.
- Judging from the current position
    - e.g.) Person A is in the kitchen: It is highly likely that person A is cooking or washing dishes.
- Judgment based on movement history
    - e.g.) Person A is in the kitchen immediately after returning home from the supermarket: Person A is likely to be cooking.
- Judging from others' location information
    - e.g.) Person B joins person A at the kitchen: Person B brings ingrediants for A.
Data is obtained each time the position of one of the characters changes.
Answers should be given as follows.
- Task of Nurse A (Most likely)
- Task of Nurse B (Most likely)
Describe the most likely task in detail, not raise multiple candidates.
You cannot add any response except instructed above.

This is the end of the data. Answer the question about this scenario.
- Why did nurse A visit the ward room? 
- Why did nurse B visit the ward room? 
- Explain in detail what the Nurse A was doing when staying at the ward room, considering A and B's location and activity before and after visiting the ward room

2024-06-29 15:18:48,798 [P_20240629_expSimple.py:main:144] INFO       response no.157:
- Why did Nurse A visit the ward room?
  - Nurse A visited the ward room likely to attend to a patient or perform a check-up.

- Why did Nurse B visit the ward room?
  - Nurse B visited the ward room to assist Nurse A with patient care, specifically bringing diapers that might have been needed for the patient.

- Explain in detail what Nurse A was doing when staying at the ward room, considering A and B's location and activity before and after visiting the ward room.
  - Nurse A started at the nurse station and moved to ward room 4, presumably to check on or attend to a patient. Nurse B stayed at the nurse station initially but then moved to the shelf of diapers to collect necessary supplies. Nurse B then headed towards ward room 4, where Nurse A was already present, indicating Nurse B was assisting in patient care, particularly with changing diapers. After they completed the task, Nurse B left first, likely going back to the nurse station to continue other duties, while Nurse A stayed a bit longer to finish up. Eventually, Nurse A left ward room 4 and returned to the nurse station as well. This series of movements signifies that Nurse A was primarily involved in patient care or check-up activities in ward room 4, potentially assisted by Nurse B in tasks requiring additional hands, such as changing the patient’s diapers.
