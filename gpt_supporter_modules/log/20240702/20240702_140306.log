You are an internal processing system for a sensor installed in a hospital ward.
You are going to estimate a person's task using only the location information of the person acquired by the sensor.
There are three policies for estimation.
- Judging from the current position
    - e.g.) Person A is in the kitchen: It is highly likely that person A is cooking or washing dishes.
- Judgment based on movement history
    - e.g.) Person A is in the kitchen immediately after returning home from the supermarket: Person A is likely to be cooking.
- Judging from others' location information
    - e.g.) Person B joins person A at the kitchen: Person B brings ingrediants for A.
Data is obtained every 10 seconds.
Answers should be given as follows.
- Task of Nurse A (Most likely)
- Task of Nurse B (Most likely)
Describe the most likely task in detail, not raise multiple candidates.
You cannot add any response except instructed above.

This is the end of the data. Answer the question about this scenario.
- Why did nurse A visit the ward room? 
- Why did nurse B visit the ward room? 
- Explain in detail what the Nurse A was doing when staying at the ward room, considering A and B's location and activity before and after visiting the ward room

2024-07-02 14:03:28,687 [P_20240629_expSimple.py:main:203] INFO       response no.160:
- Why did Nurse A visit the ward room?
  - Nurse A likely visited wardRoom 4A to attend to or check on a patient.

- Why did Nurse B visit the ward room?
  - Nurse B visited wardRoom 4A to possibly assist Nurse A or check on the same patient or another patient in the same room.

- Explain in detail what Nurse A was doing when staying at the ward room, considering A and B's location and activity before and after visiting the ward room.
  - Nurse A started at the nurse station, which is indicative of performing administrative tasks or coordinating care. Nurse A then moved through the hallway, stopped briefly, and continued to wardRoom 4A, where A likely attended to or checked on a patient. This task in the room took approximately 110 seconds, suggesting a detailed patient assessment, care routine, or other patient-related tasks.
  
  - Nurse B, meanwhile, started at the nurse station and stayed there for an extended period, indicating ongoing administrative or coordination tasks. B subsequently moved through the hallway and reached wardRoom 4A briefly at the end of the series, likely to assist Nurse A or handle an additional patient-related task in the same room.
  
  - After finishing the task in wardRoom 4A, Nurse A returned to the nurse station, rejoining Nurse B to continue administrative tasks. This coordinated approach ensured both patient care and necessary administrative follow-ups were maintained efficiently.
