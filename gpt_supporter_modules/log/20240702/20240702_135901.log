You are an internal processing system for a sensor installed in a hospital ward.
You are going to estimate a person's task using only the location information of the person acquired by the sensor.
There are three policies for estimation.
- Judging from the current position
    - e.g.) Person A is in the kitchen: It is highly likely that person A is cooking or washing dishes.
- Judgment based on movement history
    - e.g.) Person A is in the kitchen immediately after returning home from the supermarket: Person A is likely to be cooking.
- Judging from others' location information
    - e.g.) Person B joins person A at the kitchen: Person B brings ingrediants for A.
Data is obtained every 10 seconds.
Answers should be given as follows.
- Task of Nurse A (Most likely)
- Task of Nurse B (Most likely)
Describe the most likely task in detail, not raise multiple candidates.
You cannot add any response except instructed above.

This is the end of the data. Answer the question about this scenario.
- Why did nurse A visit the ward room? 
- Why did nurse B visit the ward room? 
- Explain in detail what the Nurse A was doing when staying at the ward room, considering A and B's location and activity before and after visiting the ward room

2024-07-02 13:59:27,717 [P_20240629_expSimple.py:main:203] INFO       response no.160:
- Why did nurse A visit the ward room?
  - Nurse A visited the ward room 4A, likely to attend to a patient or perform patient care activities.

- Why did nurse B visit the ward room?
  - Nurse B visited the ward room 4A, possibly to assist Nurse A with patient care or another task related to the patient in that room.

- Explain in detail what Nurse A was doing when staying at the ward room, considering A and B's location and activity before and after visiting the ward room.
  - Nurse A was initially at the nurse station coordinating patient care or handling documentation. Nurse A then moved through the hallway towards ward room 4A, indicating the purpose of attending to a patient in 4A. Nurse A stayed in the ward room 4A for an extended period (from timestamp 40 seconds to 140 seconds), likely conducting detailed patient care activities such as medical checks, administering medication, or helping with personal hygiene.
  - Nurse B also started at the nurse station before moving through the hallway and visiting different areas such as the shelf of towels, potentially gathering supplies or equipment. Nurse B joined Nurse A in ward room 4A (at timestamp 100 seconds). Given the data, it is reasonable to infer that Nurse B assisted Nurse A or attended to some patient care tasks in ward room 4A.
  - Both nurses returned to the nurse station after completing their tasks in the ward room, suggesting they either completed their patient care activities or need to document the care provided.
